        <p>My research is broadly within economics and finance, focusing on <b>asset pricing</b>, <b>investments</b>, and <b>insurance</b>. 
           My work focuses on how market structures and societal shifts shape the pricing and allocation of risk across financial markets, 
           with a focus on investor behavior and often leveraging ML/AI tools.</p>
